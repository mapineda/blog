<p>Iâ€™m a Software Developer and Entrepreneur focused on creating impactful user experiences through products.</p>

<p>I solve day-to-day problems by starting with research, then taking several solutions from paper and onto the digital realm. Within the digital world, I produce quality work in Adobe (Photoshop, Illustrator), Blender, Invision, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Angular, React and Ionic. Back in the physical realm, I enjoy riding my bicycle, exploring different neighborhoods and trails around town, paddle boarding, kayaking, yoga, and playing with my dog, Ares.
