Do a google search of 'javascript frameworks' and you get nearly 39MM results in .55 seconds. A top five search on Github lists these frameworks as the most popular in order from most popular to least:
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Angular</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Backbone</li>
    <li>Ember</li>
    <li>Polymer</li>  
  </ol>

  <This article takes an in depth look at the top two frameworks in the JavaScript development community, Angular 2 and React>

  <h2>Angular</h2>
  <p>
  Created in 2009 by Google, Angular is considered the most used JavaScript framework for developing Single Page Applications (SPA)
  Most recently, Angular 2 hit beta. I'll be comparing Angular 1 vs Angular 2 in another blog post coming soon. This post will compare Angular 2 vs React

  <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Technically, yes, React is a library and Angular, a framework; however, they still aid in the MV* functionality of the web and such can be compared.

  <h3>Features of Angular</h3>  
  <p>
  Angular 2 is all component and directive based.
